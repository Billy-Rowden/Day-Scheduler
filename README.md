# Day-Scheduler
An app that allows the user to plan their day in hourly blocks. 
## Overview
 This is the 7th challenge of my bootcamp in Front-End Web Development. I have been able to demonstrate basic concepts of JQuery in this challenge thus allowing myself to build a better foundation for my understanding of more indepth JavaScript concepts.

## Description
This challenge involved designing a day scheduler so that the user can plan their 9-5 working day in 1 hourly time blocks. It allows the user to save the events that they enter into the text area of each hour block to the local storage so that when the page is reopened or reloaded at a future point, their events are still there. The user also has the option of either clearing the entire schedule, or saving the entire schedule at the click of each respective button. The application also displays the hour blocks in different colours depending on whether they belong to the present, past, or future time of the current day.

## Deployment

Application deployed at the live GitHub URL: https://billy-rowden.github.io/Day-Scheduler/

## Usage 

A program that the user can utilise to schedule their working day from 9AM to 5PM and save their entries to the local storage so that they can reopen or reload the page at a future time for their convenience.

The following image displays a full page screenshot of the application with example entries to the schedule and the different coloured blocks (times are not accurate due to time of the challenge being worked on):

The following image displays the confirm message to check if the user does indeed wish to clear all entries from the local storage and consequently the schedule:

## Credits

Study groups with Davou Jobbi, Andrea Fontana, Ioana Iosub, Thomas Jack, Lauren Eaton, Laura Kane held to help understand, troubleshoot and debug each others code.

Research on websites including W3Schools, MDN web docs and FreeCodeCamp viewing samples of code to help understand both the basic and more indepth concepts of javascript and JQuery.
